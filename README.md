# SeReM
Seismic Reservoir Modeling MATLAB package

The SeReM package includes five folders:
-	Data: this folder contains six datasets used for the examples and the elevation dataset from Yellowstone National Park shown in Figure 3.10;
-	RockPhysics: this folder contains functions with several rock physics models described in Chapter 2;
-	Geostats: this folder contains functions for kriging and geostatistical simulations of random variables described in Chapters 3 and 4;
-	Inversion: this folder contains functions for seismic and rock physics inversion using the analytical and numerical solutions described in Chapter 5; the functions are subdivided into three subfolders: Seismic, Petrophysical, and EnsembleSmoother;
-	Facies: this folder contains functions for facies classification and simulation described in Chapter 6.
The SeReM package includes multiple scripts with several examples.

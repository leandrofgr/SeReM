# SeReM
Seismic Reservoir Modeling MATLAB package

The SeReM package includes five folders:
-	Data: this folder contains six datasets used for the examples and the elevation dataset from Yellowstone National Park;
-	RockPhysics: this folder contains functions with several rock physics models;
-	Geostats: this folder contains functions for kriging and geostatistical simulations of random variables;
-	Inversion: this folder contains functions for seismic and rock physics inversion using the analytical and numerical solutions; the functions are subdivided into three subfolders: Seismic, Petrophysical, and EnsembleSmoother;
-	Facies: this folder contains functions for facies classification and simulation.
The SeReM package includes multiple scripts with several examples.
